//! §17.8 face resolution against committed fixture fonts — issue #85.
//!
//! Every test here runs against `test-files/fonts/`, never against whatever the
//! host installs. That is the point: face selection has to be equivalent on
//! macOS, Linux and Windows, and a test that asks the host about "Arial" cannot
//! demonstrate that. The fixtures are built by `scripts/make_font_fixtures.py`,
//! which documents what each one exists to exercise.
//!
//! The resolver is a pure function of a request and a catalogue, so these are
//! ordinary unit tests wearing an integration test's clothes — they need
//! `test-files/`, which is not published with the crate, and that is the only
//! reason they live here.
