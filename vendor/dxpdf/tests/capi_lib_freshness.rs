//! Guards `go/internal/capi/lib/*/libdxpdf.a` against drifting from the
//! Rust source that produced them.
//!
//! The Go bindings' prebuilt static libraries are committed (unlike
//! `go/internal/capi/dxpdf.h`, they can't be *regenerated* by a test —
//! nothing here can cross-compile all four platforms), so the only thing a
//! test can check is *provenance*: a hash of every input that can change
//! the compiled bytes, stamped into `go/internal/capi/lib/SOURCE_HASH` the
//! last time the libraries were rebuilt. A mismatch means someone changed
//! `src/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` or the pinned toolchain without also
//! rebuilding and recommitting `libdxpdf.a` for every platform.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** `std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher`: its own
//! docs say the algorithm "is not guaranteed to be stable across different
//! versions of the standard library," which would make a bare rustc bump —
//! with no source change at all — report every committed library stale.
//! FNV-1a is hand-rolled instead: a fixed, unspecified-by-nobody algorithm,
//! which is all a staleness check needs (this is provenance tracking, not a
//! security boundary — a hash collision here just means a real bug slips
//! through, not that someone can forge one).
