//! §17.4.33 `w:shd` where two shaded cells meet — the seam an abutting pair of
//! fills leaves behind, and the property that keeps one from existing.
//!
//! ECMA-376 has nothing to say here: a cell's shading fills its cell, adjacent
//! cells abut, and the ideal geometry of two abutting rects is the same as that
//! of the one rect covering both. The difference is entirely in the raster.
//! A viewer that anti-aliases each fill independently gives the shared boundary
//! pixel partial coverage from each side and composites the two in sequence, so
//! it never reaches full coverage and a pale hairline is left along the join.
//! Whether that happens depends on the rasterizer and on where the boundary
//! falls: CoreGraphics — macOS Preview, Quick Look, Safari — shows it at every
//! zoom for a boundary at a fractional device pixel, while poppler composites
//! the same pair cleanly, which is why `pdftoppm` and the pixel-diff loop in
//! `AGENTS.md` cannot see this class of defect at all.
//!
//! It was reported against the `MediumShading2-Accent5` header row of
//! `sample-docx-files-sample1.docx`: four `4BACC6` cells at x = 66.6, 186.3,
//! 306.0 and 425.7, each 119.7pt wide, and a visible seam at 186.3 and 425.7
//! (fractional at every scale) but never at 306.0 (always integral).
//!
//! So the property is not about the spec, it is about the command stream:
//!
//! > two **consecutive** rects of the same colour never share an edge.
//!
//! Consecutive is the load-bearing word for the *fix*: fusing a pair with
//! nothing painted between them cannot change what reaches the page, so
//! `coalesce_abutting_rects` fuses exactly those and nothing else.
//!
//! The **audit is deliberately stricter than the fix**. It looks at consecutive
//! *fills* — ignoring whatever lies between them — because a seam is a seam
//! whether or not a glyph was drawn in the gap, and a rasterizer does not care
//! about the paint order that separated them. Anything it finds is therefore a
//! real defect that has to be closed by making the pair adjacent, not by
//! loosening the merge: reordering across the border layer's overlapping
//! junction squares (`tests/table_border_corners.rs`) would reopen exactly the
//! class those guard.
//!
//! That is how §17.3.2.32 run shading was closed. `paragraph::line_emit` used
//! to emit a line as fill/text/fill/text, so two adjacent runs of one colour
//! were never consecutive and their seam survived; it now emits a line's
//! backgrounds ahead of its glyphs, the way `table::emit` has always layered
//! shading before content, and the existing merge does the rest.
