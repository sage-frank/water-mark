//! §17.4.48 / §17.4.71 — the `<w:tblGrid>` must have a column for every cell a
//! row declares, and what happens when it does not.
//!
//! # The invariant, and the one place the spec leaves open
//!
//! §17.4.63 (`tblW`) and §17.4.71 (`tcW`) carry the same paragraph, word for
//! word: *"All widths in a table are considered preferred because: The table
//! **shall** satisfy the shared columns as specified by the `tblGrid` element …
//! Two or more widths can have conflicting values for the width of the same
//! grid column … The table layout algorithm can require a preference to be
//! overridden."* So the grid is the invariant, `tblW` and `tcW` are preferences
//! that may be overridden, and the spec names the conflict without resolving
//! it.
//!
//! What that leaves open is the **widths**, which is why nothing in this file
//! asserts that a `tcW` beats the grid slice it disagrees with. What it does
//! not leave open is the **seating**: a grid with fewer columns than a row has
//! cells cannot "satisfy the shared columns" for that row under any reading,
//! because there is no column for the last cell to sit in. Such a file is
//! self-contradictory and a renderer has to decide what gives.
//!
//! This file pins the half that must never move — a grid that *can* seat every
//! cell is scaled proportionally and nothing else happens to it. These are the
//! trap-detector for the repair in `build/table.rs::seat_every_cell`, which is
//! gated strictly on a grid too short to seat some row: if that gate ever
//! widens, these fail first. Seating counts exactly what the grid walk counts
//! (§17.4.15 `gridBefore`, §17.4.17 `gridSpan`, §17.4.14 `gridAfter`), so each
//! of those is pinned here as seating a grid rather than needing repair.
