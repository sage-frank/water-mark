//! §17.4.36 `insideV` against §17.4.15 `gridBefore` and §17.4.14 `gridAfter` —
//! what is painted on the vertical edge where a row's cells stop short of the
//! table's grid.
//!
//! # The question
//!
//! `gridBefore` leaves the leftmost grid columns of a row blank: no `<w:tc>`
//! covers them. The row's first cell then has a grid column to its left but no
//! *cell* to its left, and §17.4.36 defines `insideV` as the border on the
//! table's "interior vertical edges" without defining "interior". Three readings
//! survive that wording:
//!
//! * **A** — interior is a property of the **grid**. There are columns to the
//!   left, so the edge takes `insideV`.
//! * **B** — interior is a property of the row's **cells**. Nothing is to the
//!   left, so this is the row's leading edge and takes the table's `w:left`.
//! * **C** — no *table-level* border reaches the edge at all. It is not
//!   interior, because no cell faces it; and it is not the table's boundary,
//!   which is 50pt further left. A cell that wants a line there still says
//!   `w:tcBorders`.
//!
//! # Which one is right: measured, not argued
//!
//! **Word paints the table's own `w:left` and `w:right` there — reading B.**
//! Rendering `test-files/grid-gap-borders.docx` shows a 3pt red line on the
//! leading edge of `D`, `F` and `G`, and a 3pt green one on the trailing edge of
//! `E` and `F`: every gap-facing edge in the fixture, each in the table's outer
//! colour rather than `insideV`'s blue.
//!
//! That also explains the observation this fixture was built from. In
//! `test-files/bidi-visual-table.docx` the same edge is bare — but that table's
//! `w:left` is `nil`, which is exactly what B predicts. One rule now covers both
//! renders, where before they needed two.
//!
//! So a row's **first cell takes `w:left` and its last takes `w:right`**,
//! whether or not those cells reach the table's grid. §17.4.66 resolves a
//! cell edge against "cell borders and outer table borders", and a row's first
//! cell has no cell facing its leading edge, so the table's border is what is
//! left to face — `w:gridBefore` moves where that edge *is*, not what it is.
//!
//! Two earlier readings of this file were wrong and are recorded because the
//! way they failed is worth keeping. **A** — `insideV`, because grid columns
//! exist to the left — was refuted by the `nil` render. **C** — nothing at all,
//! because §17.4.35 places `w:left` "around the table" and the edge is 50pt
//! inside it — was argued from the spec's wording with no render behind it, fit
//! the one measurement then available, and is refuted by this one. The geometry
//! that made C plausible is real; it just is not what Word does.
//!
//! # How these tests are written
//!
//! Every assertion names a cell by its fill and asks what is painted at one of
//! its two vertical edges, so none of them knows a page origin or a glyph
//! metric. The fixture states its own font, so its render is directly comparable
//! to Word's — see the fixture script.
