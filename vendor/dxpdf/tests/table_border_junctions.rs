//! §17.4.66 / §17.18.2: the square where a vertical table border crosses a
//! horizontal one — who colours it, and what a `double` does to it.
//!
//! **ECMA-376 does not settle either question**, and neither does [MS-OI29500].
//! The standard specifies no stroke geometry for table borders at all;
//! §17.4.66's precedence list is about two *conflicting* declarations on one
//! edge, and a junction is not a conflict — all four segments meeting there are
//! correct and all four want the square. So the rule is this engine's, and until
//! now it was a guess: the `border_precedence` winner among the incident
//! segments, breaking a tie toward the vertical.
//!
//! `test-files/border-junction-colour.docx` is the probe that asks, authored so
//! each candidate reading predicts a *different picture*, and it has now been
//! **measured in Word**. It answers in two halves.
//!
//! Tables 1 and 2 carry 12pt `insideV` and `insideH` of equal weight and style
//! and swap which axis is darker:
//!
//! | reading | table 1 (V dark) | table 2 (H dark) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | §17.4.66 precedence, darker wins | dark | dark |
//! | the vertical always wins | dark | pale |
//! | **the horizontal wins** | **pale** | **dark** |
//!
//! Word draws pale then dark — so **colour never decides**, and both of the
//! engine's rules died in one render.
//!
//! Table 5 pairs a 12pt vertical with a 3pt horizontal, which is the case those
//! two are silent about, since they tie the weights on purpose. Word draws the
//! vertical through it. So the whole order is **§17.4.66's weight step and
//! nothing after it**: the heavier line takes the square, the horizontal breaks
//! a tie, and style and colour are never consulted.
//!
//! Table 3 crosses two 12pt `double`s, and Word draws the crossing as a 2 × 2
//! lattice of ink with *both* gaps running through it — reported as "the borders
//! are negative space, so it looks like every cell has its own border", which is
//! what a lattice looks like and what a square drawn along one axis never can:
//! with the gaps interrupted at every crossing the picture is a continuous
//! double-ruled grid, not a set of separated per-cell rectangles. That fixes the
//! *geometry* of a square independently of who colours it — it is the product of
//! the two axes' §17.18.2 rules either way.
//!
//! Every assertion below is a *relation between two renders of one document* —
//! a table against the same table with its two colours exchanged, with its two
//! weights exchanged, or drawn `single` instead of `double`. No page origin,
//! glyph metric or absolute coordinate is pinned.
