//! §17.4.38 / §17.4.66: the structural invariants of a table's border network.
//!
//! ECMA-376 says which edges a cell paints and [MS-OI29500] §17.4.66 says which
//! of two facing cells wins a shared one, but neither says anything about the
//! square where a vertical border crosses a horizontal one. That is this
//! engine's own convention, and it has now been reported wrong three times, in
//! three different shapes, always as the same symptom: a 1–2px notch at a cell
//! corner. Each report was a square that the two edges of the cell owning it had
//! both been emptied of, while the borders that actually meet there belonged to
//! the neighbouring row and the neighbouring column.
//!
//! So this file asserts properties rather than any one shape of them, over whole
//! rendered documents, and nothing here knows which cell a rect came from —
//! that knowledge is exactly what each of the three defects had too little of.
//! Three properties, which between them say the network is a set of lines that
//! meet cleanly:
//!
//! 1. **Every junction square is ink.** A junction is where a vertical border
//!    rect and a horizontal one touch or overlap; the square they join in is the
//!    vertical's x-band crossed with the horizontal's y-band. A hole there is
//!    the reported notch.
//! 2. **No two border rects overlap.** Where two do, which colour reaches the
//!    page is decided by emission *order* rather than by any rule — so a
//!    document renders one way and the same borders in another arrangement
//!    render another. Painting a square twice is the other half of the same
//!    defect as painting it not at all.
//! 3. **No collinear pair is separated by a gap narrower than itself.** A break
//!    in a line one border-width long is never deliberate: real space between
//!    two tables is orders of magnitude wider. This is the notch that the
//!    junction audit cannot see, because it is a hole in a line with nothing
//!    crossing it.
//!
//! The fixture is the reporter's own document. `test-cases/` is untracked
//! (private customer documents), so those tests are gated on its presence and
//! are a no-op in CI; the same invariants are asserted on in-memory tables by
//! `render::layout::table::emit`'s own tests, which do run there.
