//! §17.3.2.35 / §17.3.1.13: the unit that inter-character spacing is applied
//! *between*.
//!
//! Two unrelated features insert horizontal space inside a run:
//!
//! ```xml
//! <w:rPr><w:spacing w:val="40"/></w:rPr>     <!-- §17.3.2.35: +2pt everywhere -->
//! <w:pPr><w:jc w:val="distribute"/></w:pPr>  <!-- §17.3.1.13: share the line's slack -->
//! ```
//!
//! They differ in where the amount comes from — `w:spacing` is authored, while
//! `distribute` is derived per line from the width left over — but they land in
//! the same place, add up (`font.char_spacing + distribution_extra`), and reach
//! the painter as the single `char_spacing` field of `DrawCommand::Text`.
//!
//! So both need one answer to one question: **where may space go?**
//!
//! # The unit is a grapheme cluster
//!
//! This module owns that answer, and it is the UAX #29 extended grapheme
//! cluster. [`unit_count`] says how many helpings of spacing a run earns;
//! [`units`] says which substrings the painter draws between them. Layout and
//! paint call the same two functions, which is the whole reason the module
//! exists — a run that measures to one width and paints at another leaves its
//! underline, its run border and its hyperlink rect behind.
//!
//! Counting Unicode **scalars** instead, which is what this code did until
//! issue #82, breaks any cluster spelled with more than one:
//!
//! | Text | Scalars | Clusters | Scalar counting drew |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `e` + `U+0301` | 2 | 1 | the acute accent a spacing step right of its `e` |
//! | `1` `U+FE0F` `U+20E3` | 3 | 1 | a digit, a gap, and a bare keycap ring |
//! | `U+1F1E9` `U+1F1EA` | 2 | 1 | two lettered squares instead of a German flag |
//! | `U+0915` `U+094D` `U+0937` | 3 | 1 | a conjunct pulled apart at its virama |
//!
//! # Who asks
//!
//! | Caller | Uses it for |
//! |---|---|
//! | `layout::measurer::measure` | §17.3.2.35 — adds `char_spacing × unit_count` to the measured width |
//! | `layout::paragraph::line_emit::distribution_unit_count` | §17.3.1.13 — how many units a fragment contributes, hence how many gaps a line has to fill |
//! | `render::painter`, the `char_spacing != 0` arm | draws one unit at a time, advancing by the unit's own advance plus `char_spacing` |
//! | `layout::fragment::split` | per-unit fragments for an over-wide word |
//!
//! The last is not spacing at all, and is governed here for the same reason:
//! splitting an over-wide word per *scalar* gave the line-fitter permission to
//! break between a letter and its own accent and carry the mark to the next
//! line.
//!
//! # Why not the shaped cluster
//!
//! A shaping engine reports finer, script-aware boundaries, and issue #82 asks
//! for them. For **most** text they would be boundaries the painter cannot
//! honour: `draw_str` and `TextBlob::from_str` map codepoints to glyphs through
//! the cmap alone, with no GSUB, and that is still the path every Latin,
//! Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, Hebrew and Thai run takes.
//!
//! Since issue #131 it is no longer the path *every* run takes. A run in a
//! cursive-joining script — the ones [`crate::render::shape::needs_shaping`]
//! picks out — is shaped through HarfBuzz and painted with `draw_glyphs_at`,
//! so for those runs a shaped cluster is a boundary the painter could honour.
//! This module does not yet offer one, and the consequence is stated at the
//! seam that decides it (`layout::fragment::shape`): §17.3.2.35 `w:spacing` and
//! §17.3.1.13 `distribute` are **not applied to a shaped run**, because
//! inserting space at grapheme-cluster boundaries that shaping has since
//! ligated across would put it in the wrong places, and neither measurement
//! nor paint adds it.
//!
//! So the seam this module's own doc used to point at is now half-crossed. What
//! remains for issue #82 is the other half: make the unit here the shaped
//! cluster for a shaped run, and every caller above stays as it is. Indic
//! reordering waits on the same change — README tracks it as its own row, and
//! that is why it is not simply another entry in
//! [`crate::render::shape::needs_shaping`]'s predicate.
