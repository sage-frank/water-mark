/// compatibility. `sdkjs`, in `word/Editor/Table/TableRecalculate.js`, insets
/// each cell within its grid slot by `CellSpacing` on the table's outer sides

/// a table-level and a row-level declaration, since the only fixture measured at
/// the time (`issue-165-cellspacing.docx`) declares 400 in both places.
///
/// Tables 2 and 3 of the scale probe declare the spacing at **table level only**
/// and Word doubles them anyway. There is nothing to sum, so the factor is real

///
/// * does that row re-carve the grid from its own spacing — misaligning its
///   column boundaries with the rows above and below — or inset within the slots
///   the table-level value produced, leaving it short of the table edge?
///   §17.4.43's "Row-level cell spacing shall not increase the width of the
///   overall table" rules out growing the table and does not choose between
///   these.
/// * what is the table's reported width when rows disagree? It is
///   `sum(slots) + cell_spacing` today, and it drives pagination, floating-table
///   registration and `jc` placement — so a wrong answer moves the whole table,
///   not one row.
/// * is border collapsing still table-wide? `collapse_borders` is
///   `cell_spacing <= 0` for the entire table, so a per-row answer would collapse
///   one row's borders and not its neighbour's, and no section says whether Word
///   does that.
///
/// So a table whose rows **agree** takes that value, and one that does not keeps

/// * a *nested* table is measured against the page rather than against its

/// * §17.4.66 draws a table's outer border **outside** its box
///   (`table::borders::rasterize_border_grid`), and this is given the grid,
///   not the borders that will be drawn around it — so a clamped table's own
///   right border hangs off the sheet by its own width. Threading the resolved
///   border config down here to subtract it would make the guard depend on a
///   later phase; the overflow it leaves is one border wide rather than the
///   460 pt the reported defect drew, and `tests/table_auto_width.rs` bounds it
///   at exactly that.

/// satisfy the shared columns as specified by the `tblGrid` element … Two or
/// more widths can have conflicting values for the width of the same grid column
/// … The table layout algorithm can require a preference to be overridden."*
///
/// So the grid is the invariant and both width elements are preferences that may
/// lose to it — and the spec states the conflict without resolving it. That is
/// why nothing here lets a `tcW` override the grid column it disagrees with:
/// which one Word believes is open, and settling it needs a **Word reference
/// render**, not a rule invented at this line. `w:tcW` is read here and nowhere
/// else in `src/render/`.
///
/// What is *not* open is the seating. A grid with fewer columns than a row has
/// cells cannot satisfy the shared columns for that row under any reading of the
/// sentence above, because the last cell has no column to be satisfied in. The
/// file contradicts itself and something has to give.
///
/// # Why the cell may not be what gives
///
/// It used to be. Both this module and `table/measure.rs` clamp the grid walk to
/// the declared column count so a short grid cannot panic on a slice index —
/// and the clamp gives the overrun cell an empty slice, so it laid out at zero
/// width, stacked at the table's right edge under the previous cell's border.
/// Its text, borders and shading were all emitted and none of them were legible.
///
/// Content drawn at zero width is gone from the PDF exactly as content drawn off
/// the paper is, which is the line `clamp_auto_grid_to_page` above is already
/// drawn at, and for the same reason: it is the one consequence every reading of
/// every layout property agrees is wrong. So the grid grows to fit the cells
/// rather than the cells shrinking to fit the grid.
///
/// # The repair is minimal, and that is a choice
///
/// The declared columns are kept exactly as declared and the missing ones are
/// appended. Every row the grid *could* seat therefore lays out unchanged, which
/// is the property that keeps this off all 398 tables in the corpus.
///
/// LibreOffice resolves the same input differently — `DomainMapperTableManager`
/// discards the grid entirely once the cell count disagrees with it and rebuilds
/// the separators from the declared cell widths — and that is the reading with
/// 13 years of third-party-producer pressure behind it. It is also the larger
/// change: it moves rows that were already seated. Neither is derivable from
/// §17.4.48, and a **Word reference render** of a table whose grid is one column
/// short is what would choose between them.
///
/// # Sizing an appended column
///
/// From the unseated cell's own `w:tcW`, which is the only width the file offers
/// for a column the grid never mentioned. Where a cell straddles the end of the
/// declared grid, the columns it already has are subtracted first and the
/// remainder is split evenly across the new ones. Rows may disagree about the
/// same appended column, and the widest claim wins: a narrower one would put
/// some row back into less width than it declared, and taking the first or last
/// row's claim instead would make the result depend on row order, which nothing
/// in §17.4.48 supports.
///
/// Only `w:type="dxa"` counts. §17.4.71's `pct` is a fraction *of the table's
/// own width*, and the table's width is computed from the grid this function
/// returns — so reading it here would be circular. Such a cell falls to the
/// same default as one that declares nothing: the mean of the declared columns,
/// or an arbitrary equal unit when there are none, which reproduces the
/// equal-distribution fallback in `compute_column_widths` exactly.
///
/// # Only cells count toward the demand
///
/// §17.4.15 `gridBefore` is counted because it displaces real cells rightward.
/// §17.4.14 `gridAfter` is **not**: it declares trailing columns that hold no
/// cell, so a grid too short for them loses no content, and appending for it
/// would narrow a cell that renders perfectly well today on nothing but

///
/// # The demand is bounded by the cells, not by the attributes

    // folds in here, so both sources feeding `style_table` are covered. A
    // document declaring one of them in a style either fails to open in Word or
    // renders without it; reading it would render a third-party document
    // differently from the Word its author checked it against.
    //
    // Five of those seven are modelled and read here — `tblW`, `tblLook`,
    // `tblpPr`, `tblOverlap`, `bidiVisual` — so each is taken from the
    // `<w:tbl>` alone below, and `merge_table_properties` omits all five from
    // its field list. `tblLayout` has no read site at all. The last needs no
    // code: `tblStyle` is already excluded from `merge_table_properties` for an

    // at. ECMA documents them under Table Styles to match (§17.7.6.5 and
    // §17.7.6.7, not §17.4), and the corpus agrees without exception: 693
    // band-size declarations across 8 documents, every one in a style's
    // `tblPr`, none on a table. The direct read below is kept anyway — it costs
    // nothing and honours a producer Word would not.

    // `cell_margins` and `borders` merge *per edge*, since §17.4.42 and

    // single value, so the direct occurrence simply wins outright.
    //
    // Note the narrowing is of the **application** only. `merge_table_

    // # The leading border's half
    //
    // §17.4.66 straddles a table's own left edge on its first grid line, so half
    // of that border falls to the left of the grid and half is charged to the
    // first cell's content (`table::borders`, `measure_table_rows`). Word puts
    // that cell's **text** at the indent, not the grid line: measured against
    // `test-files/border-outer-box.docx`, whose two tables differ only in outer
    // border weight — the 12pt one draws its frame at 60..72 against a 300pt
    // grid and carries its *interior* line 6pt left with it, which straddling
    // alone cannot do. So the grid starts half a leading border to the left of
    // the indent, and the charged half puts the text back on it.
    //
    // Which is the same rule as the cell-margin shift above, one level up: both
    // are the first cell's content inset, and the content is inset by whichever
    // of the two is larger. They are combined only where that shift applies,
    // though — the corpus tuning it was drawn from is untouched by this
    // measurement, whose fixture declares no cell margins at all.
    //
    // # Only a *table-level* border shifts the table, and that is unmeasured
    //
    // The width read here is `border_config.left`, so a leading border declared
    // by the first cell (§17.4.39 `w:tcBorders/w:left`) or by a row's §17.4.60
    // `tblPrEx` override moves nothing: the rasterizer straddles whatever line
    // wins the outer edge, so that border's outer half lands in the margin with
    // no shift to answer it, while a table-level border of the same weight is
    // compensated. `tests/table_bidi_visual.rs` renders both and pins the
    // straddle in each; what it cannot say is whether Word shifts for them too.
    //
    // Not repaired here, because the fix and its refutation cost the same
    // measurement and only one of them can be guessed at. `border-outer-box.docx`
    // declares its borders at table level only, so nothing on record separates
    // "the table shifts by whatever border stands on its leading edge" from "the
    // table shifts by what `tblBorders` declares". **Word reference render
    // needed**: that fixture's thick table again, with its `w:left` moved from

/// # The defect this exists for

/// *restart* cell's content precisely because there is one to show.
///
/// # The choice, and why it is a choice
///
/// §17.4.84 does not say what an unpaired `continue` means, so "promote it to

/// merge the author did not write, and one whose extent is guesswork), or to
/// drop the cell but keep its height (which loses the text just as surely).
///
/// **LibreOffice does the same thing**, which is corroboration rather than
/// proof: in `sw/source/core/unocore/unotext.cxx`, `lcl_ApplyCellProperties`
/// looks for an open merge group at the cell's position, and when it finds
/// none leaves `bFound` false, logs `SAL_WARN("sw.uno", "couldn't find first
/// vertically merged cell")` and does nothing else — the cell is never added to
/// a merge group and keeps the default RowSpan of 1, so it renders full height
/// with its content intact. The binary filter agrees: `ww8par2.cxx` treats a
/// null `FindMergeGroup` as "not merged". LibreOffice flags this explicitly as
/// a malformed-input fallback, so it is evidence about what a second
/// implementation chose, not about what Word does.
///
/// **A Word render would settle it** — a document with a `continue` cell that
/// no `restart` precedes, carrying text, rendered in Word: whether that text
/// appears, and whether its row takes its natural height, decides between this
/// choice and the implicit-`restart` one. Until then the fix is scoped to the
/// part every candidate reading agrees on, which is that the content survives.
///
/// # Which grid column, and why only one
///
/// A merge is tracked here per **grid column**, because `gridBefore` and
/// `gridSpan` make "which column" and "which cell index" different questions.
/// *Which* column is not a free choice either: the passes this repair has to
/// agree with anchor a merge on the restart cell's **first** column and no
/// other. `expand_rows_for_vmerge` walks down from a restart while
/// `is_vmerge_continue(row_below, entry.grid_col)` holds, and `entry.grid_col`
/// is that first column; `merged_span_height` repeats the same walk when it
/// emits. A `gridSpan="2"` restart therefore joins whatever covers its leftmost
/// column, and nothing else — the second column it spans opens no merge.
///
/// So a `Restart` opens `cols.start` alone, and a paired `Continue` carries
/// forward only the columns it covers that were **already** open, never the
/// rest of its own span. Both halves are load-bearing, and each was its own
/// content-losing bug while this pass paired on "any column the cell covers":
///
/// * a `Restart` opening its whole span made a narrower `Continue` *beside*
///   the restart's column read as paired. The merge passes looked in the
///   restart's column, found that row's ordinary cell there and never merged,
///   so `measure_table_rows` left the `Continue` with an empty `CellLayout` and
///   its text never reached the page.
/// * a `Continue` re-opening its whole span let a **wider** continuation
///   propagate openness into a column no `Restart` had ever begun, and an
///   orphan below it in that column was dropped the same way.
///
/// Stating the rule this way makes the two passes agree exactly rather than
/// approximately, which is what the "repair" has to mean: a cell this pass
/// promotes is precisely one that no merge would have sized or drawn, so
/// promoting it can only ever turn nothing into the cell the author wrote.
///
/// Both shapes are asserted end-to-end in `tests/table_row_height.rs` over
/// **spanning** cells, because a rule stated in grid columns cannot be tested
/// by a fixture whose every cell is one column wide — which is why the leak
/// survived a suite of span-1 fixtures.

/// Because they are the *logical* edges. The Transitional `w:left`/`w:right`
/// this parser reads are Strict's `w:start`/`w:end` — which is why
/// `docx::parse::properties::schema::border` and `::insets` already declare each
/// pair as serde aliases of one another, and why `w:ind` has been logical in
/// this engine since it was written (`paragraph::line_emit::physical_left_inset`).
/// A cell's `w:left` border therefore belongs at its logical start, which under
/// `bidiVisual` is on the right.
///
/// # What this function does not do, and what does it instead
///
/// §17.4.50 `tblInd` and §17.4.28 `jc` place the *table*, not its columns, so
/// they are not rewritten here — but they **are** read against this element, at
/// the placement site, through `BuiltTable::direction`. This function was once
/// the whole of §17.4.1's implementation, on the reading that the element scopes
/// to cell order; `test-files/bidi-visual-table.docx` rendered in Word refutes
/// that, putting the `bidiVisual` table at the right margin and its otherwise
/// identical control at the left. The fixture is a controlled experiment for it:
/// every cell paragraph in both tables is RTL, so paragraph direction cannot be
/// what moves one and not the other. §17.4.60 `tblPrEx` may also carry
/// `bidiVisual` to flip a single
/// row, which is not read — a row mirrored against its own table would break the
/// one-grid-order-per-table assumption every subsystem above relies on, so it
/// needs its own design rather than a flag here.
///
/// # Ordering
///
/// This must run **after** §17.7.6 conditional formatting has been resolved
/// (`resolve_cell_conditional`, in the row loop above), which reads logical grid
/// columns. `firstColumn` means the logical first column — the rightmost one
/// once mirrored, as Word renders it. Moving this call earlier would silently

/// ECMA-376 §17.4.68 (`tcMar`, "Single Table Cell Margins") defines the cell
/// margin as a per-side exception over §17.4.42 (`tblCellMar`, the table-level
/// default). Each side is a `CT_TblWidth` (§17.4.87), where `@type="dxa"
/// @w="N"` is an explicit `N`-twip value. The spec is silent on how
/// *neighbouring* cells in the same row interact when their per-cell margins
/// disagree — there is no row-level "content area" concept defined in
/// §17.4.78 (`tr`) or §17.4.80 (`trHeight`).
///
/// The de-facto behaviour of every mainstream renderer (Word and LibreOffice
/// Writer in particular) is to compute a row-uniform content inset:
///
/// ```text
/// row.uniform_top    = max(cell.tcMar.top    for cell in row)
/// row.uniform_bottom = max(cell.tcMar.bottom for cell in row)
/// ```
///
/// and to position every cell's content within that uniform inset regardless
/// of the cell's own per-cell override. Without this pass, a cell with an
/// explicit `tcMar.top=0` in a row whose siblings inherit a larger value sits
/// flush against the row's top border while its neighbours sit padded — a
/// positioning no mainstream editor produces.
///
/// # Empirical basis
///
/// Verified against the `Wohnungsübergabeprotokoll` sample (LibreOffice
/// origin) by editing the DOCX directly and observing Word's render:
///
/// 1. Rewriting all `<w:tcMar><w:top w:w="0"/></w:tcMar>` to
///    `<w:top w:w="1"/>` produced **byte-equivalent visual output** — Word
///    is invariant to the literal value at this magnitude, ruling out
///    "Word treats `w=0` as no-override" as the explanation.
/// 2. Rewriting just one cell's `<w:tcMar>` to `<w:top w:w="500"/>` (≈ 25pt)
///    pushed **every** cell in that row down by ~25pt, confirming the
///    row-wide max(...) discipline.
///
/// # Scope
///
/// Only `top` and `bottom` are normalized. `left` and `right` stay per-cell
/// because each column's content width is independent — there is no shared
/// row-wide horizontal area in the de-facto layout, and editors do honour
/// per-cell horizontal overrides.

/// Applied at the build layer (post per-side `<w:tcMar>`/`<w:tblCellMar>`
