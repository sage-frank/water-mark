    /// ECMA-376 says only "the height of the current table row" and specifies no
    /// stroke geometry for table borders anywhere, so it cannot say whether a
    /// row's rules are part of its height. Word can, and a re-measurement of
    /// `test-files/issue-157-empty-row-edge.docx` on 2026-09-05 (pixel-counted
    /// off a fresh render, calibrated against the table's own fixed-layout
    /// width rather than eyeballed) settled it a second time: `atLeast` draws
    /// the full 40pt table 5 declares, rules outside as before, but `exact`
    /// draws only **~37pt** for table 4's identical 40pt — short by exactly
    /// half of each of its two 3pt interior rules. `AtLeast` is a floor on
    /// *content*, unrelated to the borders around it; `Exact` pins the row's
    /// total box, which the interior rules eat into from both sides the same
    /// way a shared vertical eats into a cell's width. Table 3's 2pt row (less
    /// than the 3pt charged from each side) floors at zero rather than going
    /// negative, which is consistent with the same rule rather than a separate
    /// collapse.
    ///
    /// # Two rival readings, both refuted by a render
    ///
    /// The first (shipped briefly) was that `Exact`'s declared height *contains*
    /// the rules on **both** its interior boundaries in full, by analogy with
    /// `border-content-charge.docx`'s shared-vertical finding taken literally
    /// rather than halved. Table 4's 40pt-against-6pt-of-rule refuted it: Word's
    /// ~37pt is 3pt short of 40, not 6.
    ///
    /// The second (recorded here from 2026-08-19 to 2026-09-05, and the reason
    /// this doc comment is now on its third telling) was that the rules stand
    /// **wholly** outside the box for `Exact` too, the same as `AtLeast` — drawn
    /// from a render that, in hindsight, mismeasured table 4 as a clean 40pt.
    /// What both wrong readings share is that they came from a single
    /// measurement each; the fixture's own tables 2 and 3 warn about exactly
    /// this, since a 2pt cell and a hairline are not distinguishable by eye —
    /// this reading is the first to also fit table 3 without a separate case
    /// for the floor.

    /// # `w:val="0"` is not a height
    ///
    /// It is the marker for *unconstrained*, and Word honours it as one even
    /// under `hRule="exact"`: table 2 of that fixture declares zero and Word
    /// draws a full row of cell. [MS-OI29500] §2.4.77(c) is the corroboration —
    /// it records that Word requires `val="0"` whenever `hRule="auto"`, which is
    /// the same fact from the producing side. A literal reading draws a flat row
    /// and loses the cell entirely, which is what this engine used to do. This
