//! Table borders — §17.4.66 resolution, and the drawing of what it resolved.
//!
//! Everything starts from [`declare_cell_borders`], which answers what each cell
//! *declares* on its four edges and looks across none of them:
//! [`resolve_cell_effective_borders`] maps the table's borders onto a cell's
//! position in its row and lays the cell's own `w:tcBorders` on top. [`CellEdge`]'s
//! three states are what makes that expressible — an omitted edge and a
//! `val="nil"` one paint the same nothing but inherit differently.
//!
//! Two readers then ask two different questions of those declarations, and the
//! split is the point of this module:
//!
//! * [`resolve_table_cell_borders`] — **how much of each edge is charged to each
//!   cell**, which insets its content box. A per-cell question with a per-cell
//!   answer.
//! * [`plan_table_borders`] — **what line stands on each line of the grid**,
//!   which is what reaches the page. A collapsed border sits on an edge two
//!   cells share, so it belongs to neither; [`BorderPlan`] is indexed by grid
//!   line and has no notion of an owning cell at all.
//!
//! Both resolve with [`resolve_border_conflict`]; only the pairs they feed it
//! differ. The doc on `resolve_table_cell_borders` says where the two disagree
//! and why that disagreement is still open.
//!
//! Emission follows the same shape as the geometry, and there are two:
//! [`rasterize_border_grid`] paints a collapsed table's grid as junctions and
//! the segments between them — every rect disjoint from every other by
//! construction — while a §17.4.45-spaced table has no grid to collapse onto and
//! takes [`emit_cell_frame`] per cell plus [`emit_table_outline`] for the
//! rectangle its cells no longer reach.

///   4. Equal style: darker colour wins (`R+B+2G`, then `B+2G`, then `G`).
///
/// **What `nil` does, and what it does not.** The note adds *"If the conflicting

/// step earlier (style → `tblPrEx` → `tblBorders`), which is the whole of its
/// difference from `none`. The facing cell's border is untouched, so
/// `Suppressed` yields here exactly like `Absent`.
///
/// Three independent facts in `IP 05 Trenches` fix the reading, and no evidence
/// contradicts it:
///
/// * a cell declaring `<w:bottom w:val="single"/>` above one declaring
///   `<w:top w:val="nil"/>` — Word draws the line, as does macOS's own DOCX
///   renderer on the same markup;
/// * a cell that *inherits* its bottom from `insideH`, faced by a `gridSpan=2`
///   spacer cell whose `nil` was aimed at the neighbouring column — Word draws
///   that line too, and it could not do otherwise: a cell paints one border
///   across its whole width, so a wide cell's `nil` cannot punch a hole in the
///   cell above it;
/// * down the document's spacer columns the generator writes `nil` on **both**
///   sides of every shared edge. Writing both is only necessary because one
///   alone does not suppress.
///
/// `nil` is still not a no-op: with nothing facing it — a table's outer edge, or
/// a facing cell that is also `nil` — declining inheritance is exactly what
/// removes the border. Both halves are pinned by
/// `tests/table_border_conflict.rs`.
///
/// **The comparison is a total order, and that is the point.** The caller feeds

    // cell's text edge**, so the grid sits half a leading border to the left of

    // What it costs is stated rather than hidden: a table's ink reaches half a
    // border past the box it reports on the left and the right, so a full-width
    // table paints into the page margin. That is what Word does, and §17.4.63's
    // auto-width guard is drawn at the *paper* edge rather than the text
    // column's precisely so the margin has room to absorb it

    // the page there is no margin to hang into, only the block above and the

    // a table's own top and bottom go *inside* the box, which is what `place_y`
    // does and what it did before any of this.

    // moves when the border grows. `border-outer-box.docx` asks only the
    // horizontal question.

/// edge — a junction is not a conflict, since all four segments meeting there
/// are correct and all four want the square.
///
/// So the rule is this engine's, and it is now **measured** rather than guessed.
/// `test-files/border-junction-colour.docx` is the probe, and its tables answer
/// in two halves. Tables 1 and 2 carry 12pt `insideV` and `insideH` of equal
/// weight and style and swap which axis is darker; Word draws the pale crossing
/// then the dark one, so **at equal weight the horizontal takes the square** and
/// colour never decides. Table 5 pairs a 12pt vertical with a 3pt horizontal —
/// the case those two are silent about — and Word draws the vertical through it,
/// so **the heavier line wins** and the horizontal only breaks a tie.
///
/// Which is §17.4.66's own weight step, and nothing after it: weight is
/// [`drawn_width`], and the style and colour steps that follow there are
/// replaced by "the horizontal". Both of the engine's earlier rules — the full
/// `border_precedence` order, and a tie broken toward the vertical — are
/// refuted, the first by tables 1 and 2 and the second by them as well.
///
/// The caller picks the colour; **both** lines are returned because the square
/// is not one colour's rect. §17.18.2 splits each axis across its own short
/// side, and the square is the **product** of the two splits, whichever won it.
/// Word's third table crosses two 12pt `double`s and draws a 2 × 2 lattice of
/// ink with both gaps running through — reported as "the borders are negative
/// space, so it looks like every cell has its own border", which is what a
/// lattice looks like and what neither a single square nor a pair of rungs can
/// be. So each axis contributes its own [`sub_rules`], and a `single`
/// contributing one full band is the same rule, not a case.
///
/// Within each axis the two facing lines are ranked by **declared width first**
/// and [`border_precedence`] only to break a tie. Width first because the square
/// is as wide as the widest line reaching it (`v_at_node`/`h_at_node`), so
/// dividing it by any other line's rules would put the crossing out of step with
/// the segment it continues.
///
/// **Word reference render needed** for the one shape the probe does not settle:

    ///
    /// Two 100pt slots at a 20pt `w:tblCellSpacing`. The slots were already
    /// shrunk by `build/table.rs::reserve_cell_spacing`, so the table's own
    /// width is 200 + 20 = 220, and each cell is inset one spacing: cell 0 at
    /// x = 20 with width 80, cell 1 at x = 120. Each row box is one 14pt line,
    /// plus the 1pt horizontal border that lies inside it, plus its own 20pt
    /// leading gap; the table adds one trailing gap at its bottom edge:
    /// 35 + 35 + 20 = 90.
    ///
    /// Each row holds exactly *one* horizontal border and not two, which is why
    /// 35 and not 36: with a spacing the table's own top and bottom belong to
    /// the outline, so row 0 has only its `insideH` bottom and row 1 only its
    /// `insideH` top.
    ///
    /// [MS-OI29500] §17.4.66 — *"if the cell spacing is nonzero … all cell
    /// borders and outer table borders display"* — so both appear, and neither
    /// stands in for the other: the outline is the table's own 220 × 88
    /// rectangle, the cell edges are the cells'. The outline is emitted last,
    /// after every row.
    ///
    /// §17.4.38: **every one of a cell's borders is inside its own box**, which
    /// with a spacing is the whole of the cell — there is no shared edge and no
    /// band reserved for one, as `measure_table_rows` says where it declines to
    /// reserve it. Row 0's bottom therefore sits at 34..35, flush with the
    /// inside of its box, exactly as its top sits flush with the inside of the
    /// other end. It used to be drawn at 34..35 of a box that ended at 34, one
    /// width *below* the box and so inside the 20pt spacing, because the
    /// emitter extended a cell's border box by its own bottom border's width
    /// whenever a row followed it — a rule meant for the band between two rows
    /// that share an edge, applied where there is no band and no shared edge.
    /// A spacing narrower than the border would have put a cell's bottom border
    /// inside the next row's box.
    ///
    /// Being inside the box is also why the box has to be tall enough to hold
    /// it. The row is 15pt of box for 14pt of line, and the border occupies the
    /// last point of it rather than the last point of the content.
