//! Cluster-level splitting of over-wide text fragments.
//!
//! A word wider than the space available can't be broken at a normal break
//! opportunity, so it is split into one fragment per grapheme cluster and the
//! line-fitter breaks between them. Used for narrow table cells and deep
//! indents.
//!
//! The unit is the same one spacing is inserted between
//! ([`crate::render::spacing`]) — and for the same reason. Splitting per
//! *scalar*, which this module used to do, let the line-fitter break between a
//! letter and its own combining mark and carry the accent to the next line.
