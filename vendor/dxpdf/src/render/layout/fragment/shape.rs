//! Marking the fragments that must be shaped, and re-measuring them.
//!
//! The counterpart to [`crate::render::shape`] on the fragment side, and the
//! same division [`crate::i18n::bidi`] and [`super::bidi`] keep: one module
//! knows *how*, this one knows *which*, and *what to do with the answer*.
//!
//! # Two reasons a run cannot be painted from its string
//!
//! The painter's ordinary path walks a string and places one glyph per
//! codepoint, left to right. A run goes through the shaper instead when that
//! walk would put a glyph in the wrong place, and there are exactly two ways
//! it can:
//!
//! 1. **The script joins.** A letter's glyph depends on its neighbours, which
//!    a cmap lookup cannot see — [`crate::render::shape::needs_shaping`] is
//!    that test, and Arabic is the case that motivates it.
//! 2. **The run is right-to-left.** Its first character belongs at the run's
//!    *right* edge, and walking the string left to right puts it at the left.
//!    Measured, not assumed: `draw_str` paints `שלום ` as
//!    `[ש, ל, ו, ם, space]` from x=0, where the shaper returns
//!    `[space, ם, ו, ל, ש]` — every glyph on the wrong side, and the trailing
//!    space at the wrong end of the word.
//!
//! The second is why Hebrew is in scope here even though it never joins. Rule
//! L2 reordering (`layout::paragraph::line_emit`) puts a line's *fragments* in
//! visual order; nothing but the shaper puts the glyphs *inside* one there.
//!
//! # What this costs the rest of the corpus
//!
//! Nothing. Neither reason can fire for a document with no right-to-left text
//! in it: `needs_shaping` is false for Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, Hebrew and
//! Thai, and every fragment in such a document is at an even level because
//! `super::bidi` returned without touching it. So this pass walks the vector,
//! finds nothing, and returns. That is what keeps such a document's pixels
//! identical — shaping applies GPOS kerning and standard ligatures as well, so
//! a shaped Latin corpus would reflow everywhere.
//!
//! One thing it does not do is §17.3.2.35 `w:spacing`. Inserting space
//! *between* units of a shaped run means knowing where the shaped cluster
//! boundaries are, and [`crate::render::spacing`] — which owns that question —
//! answers it in UAX #29 grapheme clusters, on the stated grounds that the
//! painter cannot honour anything finer. For a shaped run it now could, and
//! that module's own doc names itself as the seam that changes when the paint
//! path shapes. Until it does, a `w:spacing` run in Arabic is measured and
//! painted without the spacing rather than with it applied at boundaries that
//! do not survive shaping.
