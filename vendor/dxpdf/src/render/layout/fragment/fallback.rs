//! Per-glyph font fallback — issue #139.
//!
//! The third pass over a paragraph's finished fragment vector, and the same
//! division `super::bidi` and `super::shape` keep: this module knows
//! *which* text its resolved face cannot draw and *what to do about it*, and
//! the [`FallbackLookup`] it is handed knows *how* to ask the host.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! [`crate::render::fonts::resolve`] is a pure function of a **name plus two
//! §17.7.2 toggles**. All eight of its steps answer "which face did the
//! document ask for", and none of them can consider which codepoints the run
//! actually needs — the request does not carry them. So `Times New Roman`
//! resolves, correctly, for a run containing `ア`, and the paint side then maps
//! that codepoint through the face's cmap, gets glyph 0, and Skia's PDF backend
//! emits nothing at all. Not a `.notdef` box — nothing. The run is measured and
//! positioned, and the space it was given sits empty.
//!
//! Real Word documents mostly dodge this, because §17.9.3 gives every numbering
//! level its own `w:rPr` and Word writes a covering font into it. The gap is
//! content that names no covering font, which is any hand-authored or
//! non-Word-generated DOCX.
//!
//! # Why a name, and not a resolved face
//!
//! A fallback has to survive two independent re-resolutions after this pass:
//! the painter's, and [`crate::render::subset::collect`]'s. Both re-resolve
//! from `DrawCommand::Text`'s `font_family` + toggles, and neither carries a
//! typeface id — so the only thing that reaches both is a **name**.
//!
//! That is sound because [`crate::render::fonts::FontRegistry::resolve`]
//! consults its request-keyed cache first, and the lookup below pins the chosen
//! face into that cache under the name it reports. The name is therefore
//! authoritative by construction rather than by hoping resolution agrees — it
//! has to be, because a host's last-resort face is typically hidden (macOS
//! offers `.LastResort`) and plain name resolution cannot reach it.
//!
//! # What this costs a document that needs nothing
//!
//! One [`FallbackLookup::covers_all`] call per text fragment, and no allocation
//! or vector rebuild: the scan finds nothing and returns. That early-out is
//! load-bearing, and so is what it is made of — printable-ASCII text is
//! answered from a per-face flag, and the family a run resolved to is
//! remembered from the previous fragment, so the common case reaches neither
//! Skia nor [`crate::render::fonts::FontRegistry::resolve`].
//!
//! Both of those were added because the naive version was measurable, not
//! because they looked prudent. Resolving per fragment — which case-folds the
//! family into a fresh `String` and clones a `TypefaceEntry` — cost
//! `sample-docx-files-sample4` about +15 ms of its ~420, on a document where no
//! fallback fires at all. With the flag and the memo the same measurement is
//! +0.2 ms on `sample-docx-files-sample-4` and within noise on `sample4`.
