//! §17.4.57 — page placement for a floating table that may span pages.
//!
//! When a `<w:tbl>` with `<w:tblpPr>` (a floating-table anchor) is taller
//! than the available height on its anchor page, Word breaks it at row
//! boundaries and continues the table on subsequent pages. The anchor's
//! `tblpY` only positions the **first** slice; continuation slices start
//! at the top of their pages' content area.
//!
//! This module owns the pure placement decision. Row splitting is handled
//! upstream by [`crate::render::layout::table::layout_table_paginated`];
//! we take its `Vec<TableSlice>` and assign each slice to a page slot.
//!
//! OOXML §17.4.57 specifies `tblpY` semantics for the anchor itself but
//! does not formally describe overflow behavior. The continuation-at-top
//! rule mirrors Microsoft Word's observable behavior and is the
//! convention every consumer that handles overflow follows.
//!
//! Text wrapping (`<w:tblpPr>` floats register an [`ActiveFloat`]) is
//! anchored to the **first** page only — text on continuation pages does
//! not wrap, since the only content on those pages is the table itself.
//! Encoded by the `Anchor`/`Continuation` enum split below.
