//! PDF renderer for dxpdf — measure, layout, and paint pipeline.
//!
//! Takes a parsed `Document` from `dxpdf-docx` and produces PDF bytes.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! 1. **Resolve** — flatten style inheritance, split sections, extract images/fonts
//! 2. **Layout** — fit content into pages using constraint-based layout
//! 3. **Subset** *(optional, gated by `subset-fonts`)* — collect glyph usage
//!    and replace each typeface with a subsetted variant before paint
//! 4. **Paint** — emit draw commands to Skia PDF canvas (requires `skia-safe`)
