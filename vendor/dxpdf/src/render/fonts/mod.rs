//! Font resolution and caching with per-render ownership (`FontRegistry`).
//!
//! `FontRegistry` is the single source of truth for typeface data within one
//! render. It owns:
//!
//! - the document's embedded-font bytes (deobfuscated upstream by the parser
//!   per ECMA-376 §17.8.3.3),
//! - a [`FaceCatalog`] of everything selectable, host and embedded alike,
//! - a cache of resolved [`Typeface`]s keyed by the *request* that produced
//!   them ([`FaceRequestKey`]),
//! - a cache of opened [`Typeface`]s keyed by the *face* itself, so two
//!   different requests that land on the same face share one typeface — see
//!   the `faces` field.
//!
//! # How a name becomes a typeface
//!
//! 1. [`request`] turns a §17.7.2 property cascade into a [`FaceRequest`] —
//!    a name plus two tri-state toggles.
//! 2. [`catalog`] describes what the host and the document offer, reading each
//!    face's own OpenType tables through [`opentype`] when a request needs more
//!    than a family name.
//! 3. [`resolve`] runs the eight-step chain and names one [`FaceRecord`].
//! 4. This module opens it — positionally, and where the record is a named
//!    instance, baking its coordinates into a static SFNT (`instance_bake`)
//!    so embedding is correct too, not just measurement and paint. A named
//!    boundary (CFF2, WOFF/WOFF2, a `spec_next` cubic outline) falls back to
//!    `Typeface::clone_with_arguments` instead — see [`InstanceState`].
//!
//! Only step 4 touches Skia beyond reading tables, which is what lets the first
//! three be tested against fixture fonts identically on every platform.
//!
//! # Per-render ownership
//!
//! A `FontRegistry` is constructed per render and passed by reference to layout
//! and paint. The previous `thread_local!` typeface cache leaked typefaces
//! across renders — once font subsetting mutates them, that becomes a real
//! correctness bug. With per-render ownership, no such leakage is possible.
