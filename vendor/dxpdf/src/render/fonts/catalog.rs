//! Everything that can be selected, in one place.
//!
//! The catalogue turns two very different things — a host font manager and a
//! handful of DOCX-embedded font files — into one uniform list of
//! [`FaceRecord`]s, so the resolver matches names against records and never has
//! to know where a face came from.
//!
//! # Three tiers, and what each costs
//!
//! Measured on a host with 210 families / 677 faces, warm, release build:
//!
//! | Operation | Cost |
//! |---|---|
//! | `FontMgr::family_names()` | 0.04 ms |
//! | `FontMgr::match_family()` × 210 | **28 ms** |
//! | `FontStyleSet::style(i)` × 677 | 0.4 ms |
//! | `FontStyleSet::new_typeface(i)` × 677, style sets retained | 7.6 ms |
//! | `copy_table_data` × 677 for `name`/`OS/2`/`fvar`/`STAT` | 1.7 ms |
//! | parsing 32 526 `name` records | 4.6 ms |
//!
//! One line dominates: `match_family` is the whole cost of enumeration, and
//! everything else is nearly free. That is what the tiering is shaped around,
//! and it is why the previous `FaceAliasIndex` cost 35 ms warm — it called
//! `match_family` for every family on the host to read one PostScript name per
//! face.
//!
//! - **Tier 0**, at construction: `family_names()` only. Effectively free, and
//!   enough to answer "does the host have a family by exactly this name?".
//! - **Tier 1**, per family on first touch: `match_family` for *that* family,
//!   then its faces from the style set. A document naming twenty families pays
//!   twenty of the 210 `match_family` calls — about 2.7 ms, not 28.
//! - **Tier 2** ([`lookup_deep`](FaceCatalog::lookup_deep)), once per render at
//!   most: every face instantiated and its own `name`, `OS/2`, `fvar` and
//!   `STAT` tables read. Reached only by a request that has already missed
//!   every cheaper step.
//!
//! Style sets are retained from tier 1, so tier 2 does not pay `match_family` a
//! second time — the difference between 7.6 ms and 37 ms for the same 677
//! `new_typeface` calls.
//!
//! End to end on the same host, against the 35 ms the previous unconditional
//! index cost every render:
//!
//! | Scenario | Cost |
//! |---|---|
//! | Construction | 0.05 ms |
//! | + twenty families touched (the ordinary document) | 2.6 ms |
//! | + deep tier reached (a document naming a font the host lacks) | 44 ms |
//!
//! So the common case is roughly thirteen times cheaper than before, and the
//! case that pays for the whole metadata model costs about 9 ms more.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Per render, owned by [`FontRegistry`](super::FontRegistry), never process
//! global. That is acceptance item 8 of issue #85, and it is also the rule that
//! made `FontRegistry` itself per-render: the subsetting pass mutates typefaces
//! in place, so anything cached across renders can leak a font subsetted for the
//! *previous* document. The catalogue holds no typefaces and no font bytes —
//! only names, weights and axis values — so it could not leak glyphs even if it
//! were shared. It is kept per-render anyway, because a catalogue built from one
//! `FontMgr` is simply wrong for another, and `render_with_font_mgr` accepts a
//! caller-supplied manager.
//!
//! The catalogue also holds no embedded font *bytes*: the registry already owns
//! those, and a second copy of a 14 MB embedded font would be a real cost.
//! Registration hands in a typeface built from those bytes, the catalogue reads
//! what it needs, and the registry reopens the face later from its own copy.
//!
//! # Why lookups return owned records
//!
//! Tier 1 is memoized behind a `RefCell`, so a borrowed `&FaceRecord` could not
//! outlive the lookup that produced it. Records are small — a handful of
//! `String`s — and the registry caches whole resolutions, so a clone happens
//! once per distinct request rather than once per word of text.
