//! The eight-step face-resolution chain.
//!
//! A **pure function** of a [`FaceRequest`] and a [`FaceCatalog`]. Purity is the
//! design goal, not a side effect: it is what lets the whole chain be tested
//! against a catalogue built from committed fixture fonts and behave identically
//! on macOS, Linux and Windows.
//!
//! # The order, and why it is this order
//!
//! | Step | Matches | Kind of evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | an embedded font's full, compatible-full, PostScript or instance name | the document's own font, by face |
//! | 2 | an embedded font's family | the document's own font, by family |
//! | 3 | a host family, exactly | the host, by family |
//! | 4 | a host face's full, compatible-full or PostScript name | the font's `name` table |
//! | 5 | any other name the font sanctions — typographic, WWS, localized, a `STAT` style, an `fvar` instance | the font's own tables |
//! | 6 | a family plus a trailing weight word, parsed | a guess |
//! | 7 | a metric-compatible substitute | a curated table |
//! | 8 | the host default | nothing |
//!
//! Everything down to step 5 is something a font *asserts about itself*. Step 6
//! is the first guess, and it is the step this whole issue demoted: it used to
//! run before any metadata was read, so `"PT Sans Narrow"` and `"Foo Medium"`
//! were chopped into a base family plus a style word even when the host had a
//! family by exactly that name.
//!
//! # Ambiguity is an outcome, not a coin toss
//!
//! When a name matches several genuinely different faces the chain does not pick
//! one. It records the ambiguity and continues, and if nothing later matches
//! either, the ambiguity — not a bare "not found" — is what
//! [`FallbackReason`] reports. That is the difference between a diagnostic
//! someone can act on and one that sends them looking for a font that is, in
//! fact, installed twice.
//!
//! # What "selected" does not include
//!
//! Opening the face. The resolver returns a [`FaceRef`] and the effective style;
//! turning that into a Skia typeface — including applying variation coordinates
//! — is [`FontRegistry`](super::FontRegistry)'s job, because only the registry
//! owns embedded font bytes. Keeping the two apart is also what keeps this
//! module pure.
